# Introduction
BBOA are important for the radiative effect
but the magnitude and even direction are unclear
see Haywood et al (2000).
Our measurements set out to add to this 
body of knowledge using Mass Spectrometer data
(Allan et al 2001).

# Simulations
John's box model is consistent with coagulation
as the dominant growth mechanism.

# Methodology
We used a ToF-AMS to measure aerosol mass and composition
(Smith et al 2001).

# Results
We report change in composition with atmospheric age.
This is directly linked to the scattering properties
of the particles.

# Figures
This is a draft, so the figures go in a section of their own.

# Conclusions
We did some science. It was great. More science needs to 
happen, so funding should be applied for.

# Acknowledgements
My supervisor was awesome in helping me understand
atmospheric chemistry.
